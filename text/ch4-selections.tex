\chapter{\label{ch:4-sel}New Techniques in Selection Development} 
\minitoc

The upgrade new detector has enhanced measuring capabilities, which is especially important for hadrons,
As hadrons tend to have much shorter tracks and are conventionally harder to reconstruct in scintillator detectors compared to muons, the explored hadronic kinematic phase space has been relatively restricted and the reconstructed hadronic variables have relatively large uncertainties.
Since more exclusive event topology such as $\numuccopiop$ allows the measurement of high-level variables like the Transverse Kinematic Imbalance (TKI) variables, which provide invaluable insights on neutrino-nucleus interactions, it is highly desirable to reconstruct hadrons, to measure their kinematic properties as precisely as possible and to explore their phase space as large as possible.

Two of the most common product hadrons from neutrino-nucleus interaction are protons and pions. 
The default particle identification and momentum reconstruction have been developed by colleagues at T2K using the Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) algorithm. The BDT algorithm has good performance, but it is still lacking in some aspects.
For instance, as it uses only single-track information, it cannot effectively distinguish between pions and muons. 
It could reconstruct proton momentum with an excellent resolution of about $3.5\%$, but it is insufficient for TKI analysis, which is highly sensitive to hadron kinematics. 

To address these gaps, I have developed and implemented new techniques for both hadrons exploiting the precise position and $\dedx$ measurements and timeing resolution.
For pions, I have invented the pion trackless reconstruction, a novel technique to reconstruct pions without requiring the presence of a reconstructed track, thereby lowering the detection threshold and significantly increasing reconstruction efficiency for low-momentum pions. 
As for protons, I have adapted the Elastically Scattered and Contained (ESC) protons technique~\cite{Lu:2016mjf} first implemented in MINERvA to demonstrate significant improvement in proton momentum reconstruction resolution, to SFGD. 
These new techniques are applied in the development of two signal sample selections, namely the $\numucczpiop$-ESC selection and the $\numuccopi$-TL selection, where the ``TL'' refers to the use of the trackless reconstruction technique.
Additionally, to prepare for the data-MC comparisons and future cross section analysis, I have also developed a stopping pion control sample selection.

\section{$\numucczpiop$-ESC}
\label{sec:sel-esc}
     The $\numucczpiop$-ESC is adding an additional ESC selection step to the $\numucczpiop$ selection developed by a T2K colleauge.
     The details of the ESC step is elaborated below.
   %------------------- ESC ----------------%
    \subsection{Working Principles}
    \label{sec:sel-esc-wp}
    Protons stopping at rest would deposit a large amount of energy, the so-called Bragg Peak, just before it stops.
    These protons tend to have their momenta better constructed as its momentum is more strongly correlated with its range. 
    As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:dedx-pprres-eg}, protons having energy deposit below $1000$ units has large variances in momentum reconstruction. 
    \begin{figure}[h]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{figures/sel/an_dedx2_colnor_vs_p_pr_res_hist2d_al12_zoom.png}
        \caption{Proton momentum fractional difference against energy deposited at the third last node.}
        \label{fig:dedx-pprres-eg}
    \end{figure}
    Hence, these protons can be selected by placing a lower boundary cut on the energy deposited at the nodes near the end of the reconstructed tracks to have a sample with a high proton momentum resolution.   
    
   \subsection{Implementation}
   \label{sec:sel-esc-imp}
   As the ESC selection is based on $\dedx$ at the end of the proton track, a good reconstuction of $\dedx$ must be obtained first.
   To investigate the proper way of estimatiing $\dedx$, I have simulated multiple particle gun (PGUN) samples with the proton travelling in different directions in the SFGD.
   More specifically, three samples are travelling along the $x$-, $y$- and $z$-axis and five other samples are travelling at $15\deg$, $30\deg$, $45\deg$, $60\deg$ and $75\deg$ to the $x$-axis in the $x$-$z$ plane.
   As the proton direction should not affect its energy deposition, distinct characteristics of $\dedx$ along the proton trajectory can be utilized to validate the quality of the reconstructed $\dedx$.
   Other than the Bragg peak, another distinct feature of $\dedx$ is the minimal ionizing particle (MIP) region, where the particle at high momentum traverses the scintillator despositing the minimal amount of energy. 
   Hence, the $\dedx$ remains at a relatively constant value for all such particles.
   When the $\dedx$ at the end of the proton tracks are plotted, besides the Bragg peak at large $\dedx$, corresponding to protons stopping to rest, there should be another peak at smaller $\dedx$, corresponding protons that undergo secondary interactions and thus are stopped prematurely when it still possesses high momentum.

   The first attempt is to use the smoothed energy directly. 
   Fig.~\ref{subfig:esc-smooth-e} plots energy deposit for the last third to sixth nodes for all PGUN samples travelling at non-orthogonal angles.
   It is reassuring to indeed observe the two peaks, the MIP peak and the Bragg peak, as hypothesized. 

  \begin{figure}
        \centering
        \begin{subfigure}[b]{\dbfigwid\textwidth}
             \centering
             \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/sel/dedx5_pdf_skew_smooth_labelled.eps}
             \caption{Smoothed energy}
             \label{subfig:esc-smooth-e}
        \end{subfigure}
        \begin{subfigure}[b]{\dbfigwid\textwidth}
             \centering
             \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/sel/ans_dedx2_colnor_vs_p_pr_res_hist2d_al2_selpr_con.eps}
             \caption{Angle-normalized smoothed energy}
             \label{subfig:esc-an-smooth-e}
        \end{subfigure}
        \caption{$\dedx$ estimation.}
        \label{fig:esc-angnorm}
  \end{figure}

   However, there are still some discrepancies. 
   The MIP peaks are close to each other, but their positions differ noticeably from each other.
   This is due to the different grouping of Hits into Nodes for protons travelling in different directions.
   The different number of Hits in a Nodes lead to different distances between nodes, so using the energy deposited per Node as an estimation of $\dedx$ is not strictly valid anymore.
   To account for the different propagation directions, I divided the energy by the sine of the angle of the trajectory made with the $z$-axis.
   The angle-normalized energy is plotted in Fig.~\ref{subfig:esc-an-smooth-e}, which demonstrates that the angle-normalization step has achieved its goal - all MIP peaks have the same position.
   Hence, the angle-normalized energy can serve as a good reconstruction of $\dedx$ for the ESC selection.

   The multiple PGUN samples are combined into one large sample to determine the suitable threshold $\dedx$ values.
   While plots like Fig.~\ref{fig:dedx-pprres-eg} are clear in showing the underlying idea of the ESC selection, profile plots are better suited for determining a proper threshold as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:esc-andedx-slice};
   For example, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ans-dedx0-ppr-slice}, a cut at $200$ should be placed for the first node.
   Similarly, the threshold values for the other nodes are $500$, $1000$, $900$, $840$ and $740$ respectively.

    \end{figure}

    Furthermore, based on distributions of angle-normalized energy for the last 6 nodes, the average Bragg peak profile can be obtained by fitting the peaks of the distributions.
    As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:esc-andedx-peaks}, the Bragg peak value for each node is extracted with fitting with a Cauchy function.
    From the last node backwards, the fitted Bragg peak values are $989.5$, $1080$, $1234$, $1131$, $990.0$ and $887.2$ respectively.

       \label{fig:esc-andedx-peaks}
    \end{figure}

    The angle-normalized energy for the last 6 nodes for each track can then be compared with this average profile by a $\chi^2$,
    \begin{equation}
     \chi^2 = \Sum^6_1 \frac{(\dedx_i - \overline{\dedx_i})^2}{\overline{\dedx_i}}
    \end{equation}
    A proton coming to rest should have a similar profile, so an upper cut on $\chi^2$ could further select protons with good momentum resolution. 
    Similar to the determination of the threshold for the individual $\dedx$, the momenta fractional difference is plotted against $\chi^2$ as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:esc-mom-res-chi2}.
    \begin{figure}[h]
       \centering
       \includegraphics[width=\sgfidwid\textwidth]{figures/sel/brchi2_colnor_vs_p_pr_res_hist2d_al2_selpr_con_test.eps} 
       \caption{ppr res vs chi2}
       \label{fig:esc-mom-res-chi2}
    \end{figure}
    The upper cut on $\chi^2$ is implemented as $800$, above which considerably larger fluctuation is observed.

    \subsection{Momentum reconstruction bias accessment}
    \label{sec:sel-esc-bias}
    In Ref.~\ref{Lu:2016mjf}, reconstruction bias in the transverse component of the momentum is observed after the ESC implementation.
    Hence, such bias is also checked for the signal sample in SFGD.
    However, unlike in Ref.~\ref{Lu:2016mjf}, no apparent bias in proton momentum reconstruction is present, while such bias is observed in muon momentum reconstruction as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:esc-prmupt}.
     \begin{figure}
        \centering
        \begin{subfigure}[b]{\dbfigwid\textwidth}
             \centering
             \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/sel/pr_pt_vs_pr_pt_bias_hist2d_al14.eps}
             \caption{pr pt}
             \label{subfig:esc-prpt}
        \end{subfigure}
        \begin{subfigure}[b]{\dbfigwid\textwidth}
             \centering
             \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/sel/mu_pt_vs_mu_pt_bias_hist2d_al14.eps}
             \caption{mu pt}
             \label{subfig:esc-mupt}
        \end{subfigure}
        \caption{$\dedx$ estimation.}
        \label{fig:esc-prmupt}
     \end{figure}
     Further investigation shows that there is no bias in the muon angle as shown in Fig.~\ref{subfig:esc-mutheta}.
     Additionally, such bias is shown to be present even before the implementation of the ESC step in Fig.~\ref{subfig:esc-mupt-bfesc}, while there is no appreciable bias in the full muon momentum reconstruction.
     This could be due to a bias in the neutrino direction reconstruction.
     However, such a direction bias should have affected the proton transverse momentum as well.
     As the impact is not pronounced and the simulation software is not the final stable version yet, a correction is done solely on the muon transverse momentum for the calculations of TKI variables and further investigations on the root cause for this bias should be carried out after a stable simulation software version becomes available.
      \begin{figure}
        \centering
        \begin{subfigure}[b]{\dbfigwid\textwidth}

        \caption{mu theta }
        \label{fig:esc-muptcor}
  \end{figure}
     The muon correction is applied through the inverse of the linear fit of the bias region between $0.5~\gevc$ and $1.1~\gevc$.
     The corrected muon transverse momentum is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:esc-cormupt}, which demonstrates that the bias has been rectified.

       \label{fig:esc-cormupt}
    \end{figure}

    \subsection{Impacts on SPK}
    The ESC technique is completed with the transverse momentum bias correction.
    The overall impact of the technique on proton kinematics are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:esc-spk}.
    It has reduced off-diagonal entries significantly, which are badly reconstructed events.
    Moreover, the conspicuous line with negative slope in the $\thetapr$ has mostly disappeared.
    These could be due to a mis-reconstruction of the track direction for short protons, which are excluded by the first requirement of the ESC step, the number of nodes have to be at least $6$. 
    
     \begin{figure}
        \centering
        \begin{subfigure}[b]{\dbfigwid\textwidth}

        \end{subfigure}
        \caption{SPK before and after ESC.}
        \label{fig:esc-spk}
  \end{figure}


   The overall improvement in the SPK is best illustrated with a Cauchy fit to the proton momentum reconstruction resolution histogram as shown in Fig.~\ref{subfig:ppr-res-bfESC} and Fig.~\ref{subfig:ppr-res-afESC}, which shows an approximately $50\%$ reduction in the width of the distribution.
   This improvement is achieved at the cost of a $2/3$ reduction in the efficiency, as shown in Fig.~\ref{subfig:ppr-eff-bfESC} and Fig.~\ref{subfig:ppr-eff-afESC} .
   The drop of efficiency might seem drastic, but it proves to be necessary for the TKI analysis, as shown later in Sec.~\ref{sec:do-TKI}, which showcases the significant improvement to the TKI variables evaluation due to the ESC technique.

    %------------------- pion TL ----------------%
    \section{Pion Trackless Reconstruction}
       As briefly elaborated in Sec.~\ref{sec:t2k-sw}, in SFGD, particle identification and momentum reconstruction are only performed on reconstructed tracks, which has a minimum length of about $30.0$~mm. 
       Hence, low-momentum particles, which travel only a short distance, could not be reconstructed at all. 
       When these low-momentum pions are not reconstructed, these $\ccopi$ events would then be misidentified as $\cczpi$ events, both decreasing the signal for the $\ccopi$ samples and increasing the background for the $\cczpi$ sample. 
       Thus, it would be highly beneficial if we could reconstruct these pions, and the pion trackless reconstruction technique I develop can address this gap perfectly. 
     
       \subsection{preliminary Study}
       \label{sec:tl-ps}
         Before embarking on the development of the pion trackless reconstruction, one important check is to investigate the potential significance of such technique, because this technique can only reconstruct pions that decay at rest.
         If there is a limited number of pions that decay at rest, the technique would not be applicable.
         Hence, a preliminary study on pion fates relevant to T2K was performed.

         The first step is to check the primary pion momentum distribution in SFGD produced by the T2K flux.
         As only a rough estimation suffices, the first $100,000$ events in the T2K input flux file is passed through the T2K ND simulation, and the event with a primary pion is recorded.
         The true pion momentum cumulative distribution is shown in Fig.~\ref{subfig:pi-mom-cum}, with the majority of pions having a momentum below $1000~\mevc$.

          \begin{figure}[t]
               \centering
               \begin{subfigure}{\dbfigwid\textwidth}
                    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/sel/inclusive_pion_mom_CDF_0.5.png}
                    \caption{Primary pion momentum cumulative distribution.}
                    \label{subfig:pi-mom-cum}
               \end{subfigure}
               \begin{subfigure}{\dbfigwid\textwidth}
                    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/sel/inclusive_pion_theta_CDF_0.8.png}
                    \caption{Primary pion angle cumulative distribution.}
                    \label{subfig:pi-theta-cum}
               \end{subfigure}
          \end{figure}
               
          The median momentum is about $300~\mevc$, while about $30\%$ of the pions have a momentum below $200~\mevc$ and $80\%$ below $800~\mevc$.
          Similarly, the pion angle distribution is shown in Fig.~\ref{subfig:pi-theta-cum}, with about $80\%$ of the pions having an angle below $87\deg$.
          \begin{figure}[h]
            \centering
          \end{figure}

          The second step is to simulate the pion propagation in SFGD with the relevant kinematics.
          A total of $6$ samples, each with $10,000$ events, with pions travlling with a momentum of $200~\mevc$, $300~\mevc$ and $800~\mevc$ and an angle of $0\deg$ and $70\deg$ are simulated.
          As SFGD reconstruction should be largely independent of the pion direction, the $70\deg$ sample is for a consistency check.
          For each sample, the fate of each pion is checked using the truth information.
          A total of $10$ fate topologies are defined as follows:
          \begin{enumerate}
               \item \textbf{DK@rest(good)} - The pion decays at rest and the total number of true trajectories is three, corresponding to $\pip$, $\mu$ and the ME exactly. 
               This is a clean pion decay at rest event. 
               \item \textbf{DK@rest(dirty)} - This is similar to the previous fate, but the total number of true trajectories is more than three.
               The additional trajectories are mostly electromagnetic showers due to the ME. 
               \item \textbf{DK@flight} - The pion decays with non-zero momentum, leading to relatively large starting momentum for the daughter muon.
               \item \textbf{Elastic knock-out} - The pion undergoes SI, leading to the liberation of an additional proton.
               The pion continues to propagate and decay, but its range is no longer well correlated with its starting momentum.
               \item \textbf{Deflection} - The pion undergoes SI. 
               No additional particles are produced, but its direction is changed.
               \item \textbf{Absorption} - Another type of SI, where the pion does not emerge from its interaction with the nucleus, so no ME is present.
               \item \textbf{Charge exchange} - The $\pip$ is converted to a $\piz$ via a charge exchange interaction with the nucleus.
               As $\piz$ decays much faster, no ME is present.
               \item \textbf{$\pim$} - There is no single interaction that can convert a $\pip$ to a $\pim$, but this fate, a $\pim$ as one of the daughters of the $\pip$, is observed, albeit rare, due to complicated pion SI inside the nucleus.
               \item \textbf{Escaped} - The pion escapes SFGD before decaying.
               Regardless of its subsequent decay, the potential ME cannot be detected in SFGD.
               \item \textbf{Others} - This fate collects all the uncategorized events, for example, where the pion produces delta electron or bremsstrahlung.
               This category should be relatively rare and thus should not require special treatment.
          \end{enumerate}
          Fate 1 to 3 are all pions that decay before any secondary interactions, i.e., the pions decay via the chain, $\pi \rightarrow \mu \rightarrow e$.
          Hence, these pions can be tagged by the presence of the ME.
          However, as illusrated below in Sec.~\ref{sec:tl-wp}, the trackless technique relies on the extremely short distance travelled by the daughter muon.
          Pions decaying in flight leads to a longer distance travelled by the daughter muon, which is not suitable for the trackless technique.
          Fate 4 to 8 are pions that undergo secondary interactions, so the ME is not present, except those that have undergone deflection, for the trackless technique to work.
          The range of the deflected pion does not correlate well with its momentum, so it is not suitable for the trackless technique either. 
          In short, the trackless technique is most applicable to Fate $1$ and $2$.

          The fate distributions are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:pi-fate}.
          For the $200~\mevc$ samples, for both $0\deg$ and $70\deg$, more than $70\%$ of the pions are in Fate $1$ and $2$.
          As for the $300~\mevc$ samples, this fraction drops to $30\%$ for the $0\deg$ and about $12\%$ for the $70\deg$.
          This is expected as the pion momentum increases, the pion decay length increases, and the probability of secondary interactions increases.
          The further decrease for the $70\deg$ is due to the increase in the escape fraction.
          The geometry of the SFGD, which is much shorter in the vertic direction, makes it easier for high-angle pions to escape.
          For the $f800~\mevc$ pions, their decay length is too long for SFGD.
          Hence, there is a significant increase in the escape fraction, about $30\%$ and $50\%$ for $0\deg$ and $70\deg$ .
          The unescaped ones are all those that have undergone secondary interactions, so at this high momentum, these pions cannot be reconstructed by the trackless technique.

          This preliminary study demonstrates that a considerable fraction of the primary pions produced in SFGD have relatively low momentum ($<200\mevc$), and for these pions, the majority of them decays at rest to produce an ME that could be utilized in the trackless technique.
          Thus, the trackless technique would be applicable to at least about $30\%$ of the pion events in SFGD, thereby making it an impactful reconstruction method to develop.

       \subsection{Working Principles}
       \label{sec:tl-wp}
         The trackless technique is an extension and sophistication of previous methods. 
         It was first tried in MINER$\nu$A\cite{MINERVAPOSTER} and in the Fine Grain Detectors of ND280\cite{T2KPOSTER}. 
         In the former, at least a reconstructed cluster is required to be identified as a pion candidate. 
         The latter indeed contains a prototype of the trackless reconstruction, but it is mixed with other pion reconstruction methods and its potential is not fully explored. 
    
         There are two key points of this reconstruction technique based on the pion decay chain, $\pi \rightarrow \mu \rightarrow e$.
         Firstly, the delayed signal of the grandchild, the Michel Electron (ME), is much longer than the time scale of other processes, such as $\piz$ decay.
         Hence, the presence of the primary pion can be inferred by the presence of a delayed signal in the SFGD.
         Secondly, the pion decay, $\pi \rightarrow \mu + \nu$, is a two-body process, the kinematics of the daughters can be completely determined by energy-momentum conservation, 
         When a pion decays at rest, the daughter muon will only move about $0.12~\textrm{cm}$. Hence, the starting point of the ME is a good estimation of the ending point of the pion.
         The pion momentum can then be reconstructed by range based on the distance between the primary neutrino interaction vertex and the ME starting point. 
         A relation between the pion momentum, via its kinetic energy, and its range is obtained from an empirical fit using a PGUN sample, as shown in shown in \figref{fig:fit}.
          The PGUN sample starts from the centre of SFGD and progates isotropically.
          It has a sample size of $500,000$ with a kinetic energy uniformly distributed between $20~\mev$ and $200~\mev$.
          The $\log10$ of the true kinetic energy is plotted against the true pion length as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:pi-mombr-fit}.
          A fourth order polynomial is fitted to the central region of the plots, where the fitted line matches the data point well.

           \begin{figure}[h]
              \centering
              \includegraphics[width=\sgfidwid\textwidth]{figures/sel/pi_len_pi_len_vs_pi_ke_hist2d_al0_true_nokink.eps} 
              \caption{A degree 4 polynomial fit of $\log_{10}{T_\pi}$ against $\log_{10}{L_\pi}$, where $T_\pi$ and $L_\pi$ are the kinetic energy and the range of the pion respectively. The $p_i$'s are the corresponding coefficients of the term of order $i$. The fit is satisfactory considering the close to 1 (\mccorrect{NOT TRUE}) $\chi^2/ndf$ value. }
              \label{fig:fit}
           \end{figure}

        \subsection{Implementation}
        \label{sec:tl-imp}
            The pion trackless reconstruction is part of my $\numuccopi$ selection, which is based on the existing $\numucc$-inclusive selection. Hence, it is best to elaborate the trackless technique in the context of the $\numuccopi$ selection. 
        
            The $\numucc$-inclusive selection has identified the primary vertex position and the primary muon, which already provides the trackless reconstruction with a good approximation of the pion starting point. The following steps are implemented to identify the suitable ME and reconstruct the pion momentum in the $\numuccopi$ selection. 

            \begin{itemize}
                \item Step 0 - \textbf{$\numucc$-inclusive selection.}
                \item Step 1 - \textbf{Find suitable ME candidates.} 
                \item Step 2 - \textbf{One trackless pion cut.}
                \item Step 3 - \textbf{Kink cut.}
                \item Step 4 - \textbf{Background reduction.}
            \end{itemize}
        
            \textbf{Find suitable ME candidates.} - Loop through all delayed reconstructed objects that have more than 1 hit, if it is $30.0~\textrm{ns}$ after the primary vertex time, save it as a potential ME candidate. 
            However, it is common that the ME could trigger a shower, leading to more delayed reconstructed objects. 
            To distinguish the ME from these secondary delayed objects, a technique called the "prompt energy" was used by MINERvA~\cite{Zhang2016}. 
            Prompt energy is the energy deposited by the short muon and the short pion. 
            Even though these particles might have too low energy to leave a reconstruct-able track, they would still deposit energy, which is much early than the onset of ME. 
            Hence, looping through the cubes $30.0~\textrm{mm}$ around the two ends of an ME candidate to observe if there is energy deposited $30.0~\textrm{ns}$ before identifying the proper ME candidate. 
            Moreover, if the primary muon is contained in SFGD, it would also decay to give an ME, which is indistinguishable from a pion ME by just looking at the time delay. 
            Hence, an additional check is added to exclude ME candidates near the end of the identified primary muon. 
        
            \textbf{One trackless pion cut} - Select events that have one and only one proper ME candidate.
        
            \textbf{Kink cut} - As the trackless reconstruction does not require the ME to be near a primary track, it cannot distinguish pions travelling straight from the primary interaction until decaying at rest from those that have undergone a deflection and then decayed at rest. 
            Events with a deflected pion should be rejected as the momentum-by-range reconstruction works only for particles without secondary interaction. 
            Hence, events with an ME connected to any non-primary tracks would be rejected.
        
            \textbf{Background reduction} - Several background reduction steps are implemented, for example, an existing $\pi^0$ rejection developed by Colleagues at T2K.
            However, they are insufficient as shown by the considerable portion of CC-other backgrounds in Fig.~\ref{fig:tlpi-bf-trknumcut}.
            FIG-TLPI-BF-trknumcut
            Hence, based on logical understanding of different event topologies, I developed a series of track number cuts and a new idea, called the track family tree.
            
            An event topology resembles a family tree sideway. 
            The first generation contains the primary tracks.
            The second generation are tracks connecting to the end of the primary tracks.
            The family tree tracing step loops through all reconstructed tracks to form the family tree starting from the primary vertex.
            One useful variable is the number of generations.
            A $\numuccopi$ event should not contain a large number of generations as the primary pion can have an ME attached to its end, but there is no shower or multiple scattering.
            Hence, the number of generation is required to be smaller than $3$.
            Another associated variable is the number of lone tracks, which are not connected to any tracks in the family tree. 
            A clean $\numuccopi$ event should have a limited number of lone tracks, which could be due to noise, or low energy scattering of the ME, which leads to clusters isolated from the ME track. 
            More details of the other track number cuts are provided in Appendix.~\ref{sec:app-tlpi-trknumcut}
        
            For the events passing all the selection steps, the presence of a primary pion is implied by the existence of a proper ME candidate, and its momentum is reconstructed by range. 

     \subsection{Comparison with conventional method}
          One important advocated advantage of the trackless technique is the improved reconstruction in the low momentum phase space.
          It is imperative to verify this claim by comparing to pion momentum reconstruction using the conventional method where the pion is identified by a reconstructed track with an ME attached to the end.
          A preliminary selection based on the conventional method was developed for such comparison.
          To distinguish the two pion selections for this comparison, the one using the trackless technique is refered to $\numuccopi$-TL while the one using the conventional method $\numuccopi$-TR.
          The $\numuccopi$-TR selection is based on the $\numucc$-inclusive selection and the same background reduction steps as the $\numuccopi$-TL.
          The difference lies in the reconstruction of the primary pion.
          It is required to have a reconstructed primary track with an ME attached to the end.
          No further optimization is done so that this selection has the maximally possible phase space.
          The results of the comparison are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:tltr-comp}\footnote{Note that the result for $\numuccopi$-TL in this figure does not include the implementation of the early energy deposit in choosing the suitable ME candidate as this comparison was done at the early stage of the development.
          As the main purpose for this comparison is to demonstrate the limitation of the conventional method, the final reconstruction threshold for the $\numuccopi$-TL can be seen in results in the next section}.
          The efficiencies for pion with momentum higher than $100\mevc$ are similar for both methods.
          Below $100\mevc$, the improvement brought by the trackless technique is two-fold.
          Firstly, the efficiencies below $100\mevc$ are significantly higher for the trackless technique.
          The efficiency for $\numuccopi$-TR drops drastically below $80\mevc$.
          Secondly, the momentum threshold in $\numuccopi$-TL extends to below $50\mevc$, which is impossible for the conventional method.
          More encourangingly, this improvement in low momentum efficiency and lower threhold does not compromise the selection purity as shown in Fig.~\ref{subfig:stack-topo-tl} and Fig.~\ref{subfig:stack-topo-tr}.

          \end{figure}

     \subsection{Impacts on SPK}
          The results of the $\numuccopi$ selection using the trackless pion technique are summarised in Fig.~\ref{fig:piTLres}.
          As shown in Fig,~\ref{fig:ppi-stack}, the trackless selection has achieved the set goal - reconstructing low momentum pions. 
          There are a considerable number of events with a pion below $100~\mevc$, which correspond to a track of about $50~\textrm{mm}$. 
          Moreover, pions below $80~\mevc$ have also been reconstructed, which travels about $30~\textrm{mm}$ and cannot be reconstructed as a track. 
          Furthermore, the momentum-by-range calculation has achieved an excellent resolution at about $2\%$, as shown in $\ref{fig:ppi-res}$.
          More encouragingly, the overall efficiencies are still relatively high. 
          The step-by-step efficiencies with respect to each step is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:tl-accum-eff}. 
          The signal definition used in the calculation is to have one true muon that has travelled to the vertical TPC and one true pion that is contained in SFGD. 
          Steps 1 to 7 are the $\numucc$-inclusive selection. 
          The large drop in efficiency in Step 8 is expected as it requires exactly one pion reconstructed tracklessly. 
          All pions undergoing secondary interactions except deflection cannot be reconstructed via this method. 
          Hence, the relative efficiency of $0.37/0.66\approx56\%$ is considerably high. 
          The further significant drop in efficiency comes with the next step, the kink cut, which is a reasonable as a considerable portion of pions undergo deflection. 
          The subsequent drops are graduate cuts to remove backgrounds, which leads to a high purity of $\numuccopi$ as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ppi-stack}.

    \section{Development of stopping pion control sample}

          \subsection{Implementation}
          \label{sec:sppi-imp}
          Conventionally, selections will be used for cross section analysis, which requires a sufficient portion of all detector systematics to be properly evaluated.
          However, due to time constraint, this is unlikely to happen within the time frame of my doctoral study. 
          Hence, only preliminary data-MC comparisons are possible.
          Nontheless, as systematics evaluation is an important ingredient of cross section analysis, which is crucial for improving our understanding of neutrino-nucleus interactions, I implemented the propagation of the systematics of the momentum-by-range reconstruction for pions tagged by ME.
          To evaluate this systematic, I developed the stopping pion control sample with the following steps:
          \begin{enumerate}
          \item Find all tracks that contain an SFGD segment and segments in the other sub-detectors.
          \item Check that one end of this track is stopped in SFGD.
          \item Check the PID of this track provided by the other sub-detectors, i.e. HAT or TPC.
          \item Check that there are no other (except ME) near the track end in SFGD.
          \item A final cut requiring the presence of an ME near the track end in SFGD.
          \item Keep only the event with a single stopping pion candidate.
          \end{enumerate}
          The preliminary result suggests that the control sample consists predorminantly of tracks passing HAT and stopping in SFGD.
          As the current PID in HAT is not fully developed, I investigated further the impact of the log likelihood on pion PID.
          The logarithms of the first and the fourth element of the pull vector are most relevant.
          For conciseness, these logarithms are simply refered to as the first pull and the fourth pull respectively. 
          For the existing TPC PID, the fourth pull was set to be larger than $0.3$ and the sum of the first and the fourth pull was set to be larger than $0.8$ for pion PID. 
          Altough HAT is also a TPC, there are differences in design and thus the PID requirement could differ.
          The distributions of the pulls at HAT for postively charged tracks before any cuts on the pulls are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:pulls}, which suggests that a significant fraction of muon will remain after the TPC pull cuts.

          Hence, stricter cuts are required to obtain a pion sample with higher purity.  
          New cut values are obatined by examining the pull distributions in the narrower range as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:pulls-zoom}.

          FIG- HAT PULL ZOOM.

          This leads to a sample with over $90\%$ purity as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:sppi-pur}.

          As the HAT reconstruction is under development, the values implemented here might be subjected to further changes.

          \subsection{Systematics evaluation}
          \label{sec:sppi-syst}
          The control sample is developed with evaluation of the pion momentum by range reconstruction in mind.
          Although the selection is not finalized as the HAT reconstruction and global track matching are still subjected to changes, it is still valuable to develop the systematics evaluation framework.
          One is the to learn the method of performing systematics evaluattion, the other is to get a first glimpse of the performance of the pion momentum reconstruction in SFGD.

          The systematics evaluation follows that in the FGD analysis as outlined in Ref.~\cite{Jenkins:2022ljx}.
          While it is straightforward to examine the reconstruction resolution with MC studies, there is no truth information when analysing data.
          As the momentum reconstruction in TPCs has good resolution and is well validated, i.e. there is good agreement between MC and data, instead of comparing the reconstructed momentum to the true momentum, it can be used as a good estimation of the true momentum.
          Moreover, as the control sample selects pion tracks that travel from HAT into SFGD and the pion loses an inifinitesimal amount of energy in the HAT, the momentum obtained from the HAT reconstruction is a good approximation of the true enter momentum in SFGD.
          The devaitions of the SFGD reconstructed moentum from the HAT reconstructed momentum can be computed for both MC and data.
          On one hand, this deviation can be regarded as an approximation of the SFGD momentum resolution.
          On the other hand, the difference between the deviations of MC and data can assess the difference in the reconstruction performance between MC and data in SFGD, i.e. the systematics related to the SFGD momentum by range reconstruction.

          The distributions of the deviations for MC and data are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:sppi-res} and the fitting parameters are summarised in Table.~\ref{tab:sppi-res}.

          \begin{table}[htbp]
          \centering
          \begin{tabular}{c|cccc}
                       & MC - $x_0~(\mevc)$ & MC - HWHM~($\mevc$) & Data - $x_0~(\mevc)$ & Data HWHM~($\mevc$)\\
          \hline
          TPC-FGD & $-25.03 \pm 0.52$ & $85.38 \pm 1.20$ & $-19.43 \pm 1.41$ & $93.57 \pm 4.15$ \\
          HAT-SFGD & $-5.29 \pm 0.73$  & $7.49 \pm 0.65$  & $-10.14 \pm 4.55$  & $16.34 \pm 5.21$ \\
          \end{tabular}
          \caption{Fit parameters for the momentum deviation distributions.}
          \label{tab:sppi-res}
          \end{table}

          Both widths are significantly smaller than those, xxxx~\cite{Jenkins:2022ljx}, in the FGD study.
          However, due to the limited amount of data, the difference between the two distributions is still relatively large that the magnitude of the systematic error, xxx, is similar to that in the FGD analysis, xxxx.

          \label{fig:sppi-res}
          \end{figure}

          The systematic error paramters are then passed to the HighLAND framework to propagate the uncertainty through the $\numuccopi$-TL selection.
          The result is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:tlpi-relerr}.
          \begin{figure}[h]

          \label{fig:tlpi-relerr}  
          \end{figure}
          Due to the incompleteness of global reconstruction and the limited amount of data, this error propagation is performed with only $20$ toys, which can only serve as a proof of the succesful propagation of the systematics.
          Even though no phyics conclusion can be drawn with this limited amount of data, it is promising to observe a considerable decrease in the error for the low momentum pion, comparing to the FGD analysis, which is approximately $9\%$ to $15\%$, showcasing the strength of SFGD.

     \section{Data-MC comparisons}
          Conventionally, kinematic distributions from these selections will be extracted and passed through the unfolding process which maps the reconstructed variables to the truth space. 
          These unfolded distributions can then be used to compare directly with output from MC event generators.
          However, the unfolding process needs to account for all major detector effects, and unfortunately, a full coverage of systematics for the new sub-detectors is not possible within my doctoral study timeline.
          Hence, I have to resort to a reconstruction-level Data-MC comparisons instead.
          Although the comparison result will only be valid for the specific configurations of interaction model used to produce the MC sample, it is the only possible way to utilize the collected data to produce physical results.
     
          With the development of the pion momentum by range reconstruction systematics, it is possible to take a first glimpse of data-MC comparisons for the $\numuccopi$-TL selection. 
          As the global reconstruction is yet to be finalized and only one preliminary systematics is propagated, this data-MC comparison is merely a demonstration of how the data can be used in the future analysis, and no physics conclusion should be drawn.
          The data-MC comparisons are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:tlpi-datamc}.
          It is reassuring to observe no significant discrepancy between data and MC in the $\numuccopi$-TL selection.
          The data-MC comparison workflow is thus complete.
          Official analysis results can be readily obtained once the various systematics are in place by putting both MC and data through the $\numuccopi$-TL selection.

     \section{Discussion}
     \label{sec:technique-disc}
          The two new techniques elaborated in this chapter, the ESC selection and the pion trackless reconstruction, have shown significant improvement in the reconstruction of hadrons in SFGD.
          One leads to a $50\%$ improvement in the momentum resolution of protons, while the other significantly improves the low momentum pion reconstruction efficiency and extends the pion reconstruction threshold to $50\mevc$, which is impossible for the conventional method.
          Both the $\numuccopi$ and ESC proton selections are finished for primary muons going into the vertical TPC and SFGD. 
          The sub-sample for muons going into HAT is missing as the global reconstruction matching for tracks passing through HAT is still under development.
          However, as the two new techniques in this chapter are developed for hadrons, the performance should not depend on the ending position of the muons.
          Hence, reconstruction improvement showcased in this chapter should be applicable to the muons going into HAT as well.
          With this improvement in the single particle kinematics, it is exciting to see the performance of the reconstruction of the higher level variables, such as the TKI variables, in the next chapter.
