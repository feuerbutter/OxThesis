\chapter{\label{ch:datamc}High-Level Variables} 
\minitoc

As elaborated in the previous chapter, the neutrino-nucleus interaction is a complex process involving multiple components, including the neutrino-nucleon interaction, the nucleon initial states (IS), and final state interactions (FSI).
Hadronic single particle kinematics (SPK) are easy to measure and interpret, but they are affected by all components of the neutrino-nucleus interaction. 
Hence, changes in different components can lead to similar changes in the SPK, thereby making it difficult to use them to improve neutrino–nucleus interaction models.
To match the statistical improvement of the next generation long-baseline neutrino experiments, it is imperative to refine neutrino interaction models to significantly reduce the systematic uncertainties.
To address this issue, high-level variables are cleverly constructed to probe specific components of the neutrino–nucleus interaction.
This chapter focuses on the potential improvements in measuring these high-level variables with the upgraded ND280 detector.
Besides the well-established Transverse Kinematic Imbalance (TKI) variables elaborated in Sec.~\ref{sec:nuint-tki}, the centre-of-momentum (COM) variables are introduced for the first time to probe FSI independent of IS.
The first section provides a brief introduction to these constructed variables, while the following section presents the MC study results.
Although it would be highly valuable to perform data–MC comparisons of these variables, the current state of the global simulation and reconstruction does not permit them.
Because the global simulation and reconstruction are still under development, the ESC technique is not yet implemented in the latest analysis chain; thus, data–MC comparisons are not currently feasible.
As proton kinematics are required for these high-level constructed variables, data–MC comparisons for these variables are not possible at this stage, and improvements for these variables will only be demonstrated with MC studies.

\section{TKI}
\label{sec:mc-tki}
     With the improved hadronic SPK offered by the novel reconstruction techniques introduced in the previous chapter, the TKI variables are expected to be measured with higher precision. As in the previous chapter, the impacts of the new techniques on the TKI variables will be illustrated separately for the $\numucczpiop$ and $\numuccopiop$ samples.

     \subsection{$\numucczpiop$ selection}
     \label{sec:mc-tki-0pi}
          To demonstrate the benefits of the ESC technique, the TKI reconstruction in two samples is compared: the $\numucczpiop$-ESC and the $\numuccczpiop$-ESC sample.
          The $\numucczpiop$(-ESC) sample is selected by requiring the presence of exactly one contained SFGD (ESC) proton, in addition to the $\numucc$-inclusive selection.
          As discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:sel-esc}, the ESC technique comprises the proton ESC cut and the muon momentum bias correction for TKI calculations.
          Hence, TKI reconstruction comparisons are presented step by step.
          Note that the result shown in this section for each selection is the sub-sample where the primary muon escapes SFGD and passes through the vertical TPC. 
          For the SFG muon subsample, the improvement is similar, and the figures are collected in Appendix~\ref{sec:app-tki-sfgd-mu}.

          The impact of the proton ESC cut on the four TKI variables is best illustrated by the response matrices in Fig.~\ref{fig:mc-tki-0pi-esc}.
          All TKI variables exhibit significant improvements in reconstruction after the ESC cut.
          Most notably, the dense off-diagonal cluster in the lower-right corner of the $\dphit$, $\dpt$, and $\pn$ response matrices is appreciably reduced.
          The $\dat$ response matrix entries also align more closely along the diagonal following the ESC cut.

     The impact of the muon momentum bias correction is best illustrated with a resolution fit in Fig.~\ref{fig:mc-tki-0pi-mubias}.
     This correction has a negligible impact on the angular variables, but it helps reduce bias in the momentum variables.
     As shown in Fig.~\ref{subfig:esc-dpt-bfmu} and Fig.~\ref{subfig:esc-dpt-afmu}, the $\dpt$ fitted mean improves from $0.92$ to $0.95$ after the muon bias correction.
     Similarly, in Fig.~\ref{subfig:esc-pn-bfmu} and Fig.~\ref{subfig:esc-pn-afmu}, the $\pn$ fitted mean improves from $0.94$ to $1.01$.
     This reduction in bias can also be observed in the decreased overestimated tails in the $\dpt$ and $\pn$ distributions.

     In Sec.~\ref{sec:sel-esc}, it was shown that the ESC technique improves proton momentum reconstruction resolution but diminishes efficiency by about $60\%$.
     The results in this section further highlight the necessity of the ESC technique for precise TKI measurements.
     With the ESC technique, the upgraded T2K ND can achieve high-resolution TKI measurements with minimal bias.
     Recently, an improved reconstruction algorithm enabled an updated TKI measurement at the pre-upgrade ND280.
     This yields a standard deviation of about $27\%$ for the $\pn$ reconstruction resolution.
     The resolution of $30\%$ for the TPC-$\mu$ sub-sample is comparable to this improvement, whereas the resolution of about $17\%$ for the SFGD-$\mu$ sub-sample is noticeably better.
     There remains room for additional improvement in the upgraded measurement as the global reconstruction matures.

     \subsection{$\numuccopiop$ selection}
     \label{sec:mc-tki-1pi}
     The $\numuccopiop$ selection uses the pion trackless reconstruction technique as elaborated in Sec.~\ref{sec:sel-tl} for the $\numuccopi$-TL selection.
     Additionally, it requires the reconstruction of one ESC proton.
     Hence, this sample uses both novel techniques in Chapter~\ref{ch:techniques}, showcasing the potential of the upgraded ND280 detector in hadronic measurements.

     The TKI variables for the $\numuccopiop$ selection are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:mc-tki-1pi}.

          \label{fig:mc-tki-1pi}
     \end{figure}
     

     In comparison to the projected resolution of the $\dptt$ measurement using the pre-upgrade ND280 in Ref.~\cite{lu:2015hea}, Fig.~\ref{fig:1pi-tki-dptt} shows a $60\%$ decrease in the $\dptt$ width.

     In addition to the single transverse variables presented above, the $\numuccopiop$ sample can also be used to measure the double transverse variable, $\dptt$, the net momentum transverse to both the neutrino momentum and the muon momentum.
     The $\dptt$ resolution is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:1pi-tki-dptt}.
     Without FSI, $\dptt$ should be $0$. This special property can be exploited to select $\nu$-H events amidst $\nu$-C events as suggested in Ref.~\cite{lu:2015hea}. 
     Hence, the main figure of merit for $\dptt$ measurement is the width of its distribution for $\nu$-H events, where the hydrogen events are picked by an additional check on the MC truth information.
     As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:1pi-tki-dptt}, the fitted half width is about $12~\mevc$, which is significantly improved compared to $21~\mevc$, the pre-upgrade ND280 result~\cite{lu:2015hea}, suggesting a greater potential to apply it for a hydrogen sample selection, which will be discussed at the end of this chapter in Sec.~\ref{sec:mc-hydrogen}.

\section{COM}
\label{sec:mc-com}
When a neutrino has sufficient energy, it can excite a nucleon into a resonance state, for example, the $\deltapp$. 
This process is referred to as a resonance (RES) interaction.
Since $\deltapp$ is one of the most commonly observed resonances in neutrino experiments, this work focuses on it as an example.
Nevertheless, the concept presented here is equally applicable to other resonances, and the methodology can be easily generalized.

The resonance decays rapidly, before leaving the nucleus, via the process
\begin{equation}
     \deltapp \rightarrow \pip + \p.
\end{equation}
In the $\deltapp$ rest frame, as illustrated in the top left of Fig.~\ref{fig:COM-diagram}, the kinematics of this two-body decay are well-defined, and the proton and pion are emitted back-to-back.
The pion decay angle, $\thetapidel$, is defined as the angle between $\vecppirest$ and the $x$-axis, which is taken to align with $\vecpdel$, the momentum of $\deltapp$ in the lab frame. 
$\thetapidel$ is a resonance property that follows an underlying distribution defined by various models~\cite{Rein:1987cb,Kabirnezhad:2017jmf,Kabirnezhad:2020wtp,Kabirnezhad:2022znc}.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/COM/COM-diagram.pdf}
\caption{Schematic illustration of the COM angle. Without FSI, $\vecpsum=\vecpdel$ and the lab frame and the $\deltapp$ rest frame can be transformed into each other by $\vecpdel$. With FSI, $\vecpsum \neq \vecpdel$, the $\deltapp$ rest frame is not accessible, but the lab frame can be boosted into the COM frame using $\vecpsum$. Hence, the major difference of the COM frame from the $\deltapp$ rest frame is caused by FSI.}
\label{fig:COM-diagram}
\end{figure}

The kinematics in the lab frame are related to those in the $\deltapp$ rest frame by a boost with $\vecpdel$, as depicted in the top right of Fig.~\ref{fig:COM-diagram}. 
Without FSI, $\vecpdel$ equals the sum of $\vecpp$ and $\vecppi$.
However, the target materials of modern-day detectors are mainly comprised of nuclei with multiple nucleons, and FSI alters the kinematics of the hadrons considerably, as illustrated by the dotted arrows in the bottom right of Fig.~\ref{fig:COM-diagram}.

The altered momenta, $\vecppp$ and $\vecppip$, are the ones measured by detectors. 
Their sum generally differs from $\vecpdel$.
Thus, the $\deltapp$ rest frame, with its simple kinematic relations, becomes inaccessible.
Nevertheless, the system can be boosted to the proton-pion COM frame using $\vecpsum$, as depicted in the bottom left of Fig.~\ref{fig:COM-diagram}, where the $x^{\prime}$-axis is aligned with the $\vecpsum$ direction in the lab frame.
Similarly, a pion decay angle, $\thetacom$, can be defined between $\vecppicom$, the pion momentum in the COM frame, and the $x^{\prime}$-axis.
Due to FSI, $\thetacom$ typically differs from $\thetapidel$. 

The COM frame coincides with the $\deltapp$ rest frame only in the absence of FSI.
Thus, the strength of FSI dictates the deviation of $\thetacom$ from $\thetapidel$. 
In practice, the measured $\thetacom$ serves as a probe for studying FSI. 
$\thetapidel$, being a rest-frame property of $\deltapp$, is independent of the resonance's momentum, neutrino energy, and initial state (IS).
In neutrino event generators, $\thetacom$ deviates from $\thetapidel$ only due to FSI, which is independent of neutrino energy and IS.
Therefore, $\thetacom$ retains these important independencies.
As different resonances could have different decay properties, $\thetaR$, the similarly defined pion decay angle of a higher resonance $R$, generally differs from $\thetapidel$. 
Hence, $\thetacom$, a superposition of $\thetapidel$ and all possible $\thetaR$, will deviate from $\thetapidel$ when more resonances become energetically possible with an increase in neutrino energy. 
This deviation will be further elaborated in Sec.~\ref{sec:dis}.

Moreover, the total energy in the COM frame, $\ecom$, will be equal to the mass of the resonance in the absence of FSI.
Cutting on events with total energy far from the rest mass peak of the resonance will select events with minimal FSI effects, such as $\nu$-H events. 
The application of $\ecom$ for hydrogen event selection will be discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:mc-hydrogen}.

Up to this point, the discussion of resonance decay has been entirely general and can thus be applied to and validated by various experiments, including hadron scattering measurements. 
However, there are features specific to neutrino experiments. 
First, the resonance is generated through neutrino-nucleon interactions, which involve both vector and axial currents. 
Second, the interaction occurs within the nuclear medium. 
This work focuses on the latter, with the application of COM variables to the former reserved for future research.

While the COM angle may appear conceptually similar to the reconstructed Adler angle, $\thetaadt$, in neutrino experiments~\cite{Sanchez:2015yvw}, there are significant differences. 
Notably, the COM frame is reconstructed exclusively from hadronic kinematics, whereas the reconstructed Adler frame relies on leptonic kinematics and assumes stationary nucleons. 
Consequently, the reconstruction of the Adler frame is implicitly influenced by IS effects, whereas the COM frame's hadronic variables are impacted by final state interactions (FSI). 
Therefore, $\thetaadt$, being a hadronic variable in the Adler frame, is influenced by both IS and FSI. 
Additionally, the necessity of reconstructing the neutrino energy renders $\thetaadt$ sensitive to neutrino flux uncertainties, which are among the largest systematic uncertainties in neutrino measurements~\cite{T2K:2019yqu,T2K:2021naz,MicroBooNECollaboration:2024gvg,NOvA:2023uxq,MINERvA:2022djk}.


     \subsection{Analysis result}
     \label{sec:com-ana}
     In the absence of existing measurements of the COM angle, MC studies were conducted to evaluate its potential advantages.
     MC samples were generated using \genie \cite{Andreopoulos:2009rq, GENIE:2021npt} for T2K beam and target. 
     Several \genie tunes were compared, with the model details for each tune summarized in Table~\ref{tab:genie-tunes}. 
     Each sample consists of $600,000$ muon neutrino events, and a selection of charge current single pion and single proton ($\numuccopiop$) events was used to generate the plots.

     \end{figure}

     As illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:fsi-comp} (a), enabling or disabling FSI has a significant effect on the $\thetacom$ cross-section as expected.
     More critically, Fig.~\ref{fig:fsi-comp} (b) shows that changing the underlying FSI model from hA (10a) to hN (10b) or from hA (10a) to hA (tuned, G24-c) results in a noticeable variation in the $\thetacom$ cross-section. 
     In contrast, although numerous combinations of IS, QE, 2p2h, and RES models were tested, configurations using the hA FSI model produced nearly identical cross-sections.
     This demonstrates the potential of $\thetacom$ to distinguish between different FSI models, independent of many other factors.


     To further examine the independence from IS of $\thetacom$, the cross-section shape of $\nu$-C (with FSI on and off) is compared to that of $\nu$-H. 
     The $\nu$-H interaction is free from any nuclear effects, while $\nu$-C without FSI reflects the impact of IS, including carbon removal energy and Fermi motion. 
     When FSI is on, the full nuclear effects—both IS and FSI—are present. 
     Fig.~\ref{subfig:ch-comp-com-cc1pi1p} shows that FSI has a substantial impact on the cross-section shape, as expected. 
     The near overlap of the $\nu$-H and $\nu$-C (FSI-off) curves provides strong evidence for the proposed independence of $\thetacom$ from IS effects.

     \label{fig:ch-comp}
     \end{figure}

     Although $\thetacom$ is conceptually similar to the reconstructed Adler angle, $\thetaadt$, the latter is additionally influenced by IS effects. 
     However, Fig.~\ref{subfig:ch-comp-adt-cc1pi1p}  suggests that the $\nu$-H and $\nu$-C (FSI-off) curves remain nearly as close as in Fig.~\ref{subfig:ch-comp-com-cc1pi1p}. 
     When a stricter selection is made to select only events involving $\deltapp$ as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ch-comp-dpp} in Appendix, the small difference in $\thetacom$ reduces further while the two curves deviate slightly more in $\thetaadt$. 
     This suggests that in the absence of FSI, $\thetacom$ could be a better construction of $\theta$ than $\thetaadt$. 

     Nevertheless, the small difference between the two curves for $\thetaadt$ indicates that despite IS dependence, IS does not significantly distort the shape of $\thetaadt$ appreciably.
     This observation could challenge the claimed IS independence of $\thetacom$, as it might be due to the relatively minor influence of IS. 
     To further examine this, a stress test was conducted by varying the removal energy of carbon across a wide range, even to unphysical levels, to assess its effect on the shapes of $\thetacom$ and $\thetaadt$. 
     The results are presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:ermc-comp}.

     \begin{figure}[ht!]
     \centering
     \begin{subfigure}[ht!]{\dbfigwid\textwidth}

     \caption{Area normalized comparisons for different removal energies, $E_{\textrm{rm}}$, with T2K flux.}
     \label{fig:ermc-comp}
     \end{figure}

     As seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:ermc-comp}, variations in the removal energy ($E_{\textrm{rm}}$) do not affect $\thetacom$ at all. 
     In contrast, the $\thetaadt$ peak exhibits a noticeable shift, along with a gradual change in its shape.
     These results confirm that $\thetacom$ is independent of IS effects, while $\thetaadt$ exhibits IS dependence, as predicted.

     Another important feature of $\thetacom$ is its independence from neutrino energy. 
     Fig.~\ref{fig:enu-comp} illustrates this behavior. 
     The $\thetacom$ distribution shapes remain largely consistent for $\enu$ values between $0.5~\gev$ and $2.0~\gev$ across most angles.
     However, deviations become more pronounced at smaller angles. 
     As $\enu$ increases to $5\gev$, a noticeable rise is observed in the small-angle region, likely due to the onset of a higher doubly positive resonance. 
     If the analysis is limited to $\deltapp$ as in Fig.~\ref{fig:enu-comp}(b), it is encouraging to observe that the different curves converge, confirming the independence of $\thetacom$ from $\enu$.

     \begin{figure}[ht!]

     \begin{subfigure}[ht!]{\dbfigwid\textwidth}

     \label{fig:enu-comp}
     \end{figure}

     Besides $\enu$, another important component in the production of resonances is the part of the $\nu$-N interaction modeling that describes the resonance interaction. 
     While $\thetacom$ for a single resonance is largely independent of how the resonance is produced unless there is a strong correlation bewtween the production and decay of the resonance, $\thetacom$ will be affected by the composition of different resonances in the production process. 
     As different resonances can have different decay angular distributions and $\thetacom$ does not distinguish between resonances that have the same decay channel, different combinations of resonances in production modelling will change the $\thetacom$ distribution. 
     As a proxy to investigate the impact of a change in the resonance production model, the axial mass parameter, $\MA$, was varied to an exaggerated and most likely unphysical extent and the effect is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ma-comp}. 
     As anticipated, Fig.~\ref{subfig:ma-comp-xsec} demonstrates that varying $\MA$ alters the cross-section.
     However, it is reassuring to observe that the shape of $\thetacom$ remains almost identical, as shown in Fig.~\ref{subfig:ma-comp-area}.

     \subsection{Discussion}
     \label{sec:dis}
     The above simulation studies demonstrate that the COM angle is a novel variable with several advantages, and its measurement will be valuable for studying FSI independently of IS.

     Although the analysis focus of $\thetacom$ is on nuclear effects, it is inherently affected by the resonance interaction modelling. 
     Fortunately, the $\nu$-N interaction is relatively well-understood, particularly through direct studies of $\nu$-H interactions. 
     As a result, future RES modeling is not expected to deviate drastically from current predictions, which are constrained by bubble chamber data.
     Even if the RES model were to change significantly, as explored in Fig.~\ref{fig:ma-comp}, the impact on the shape of $\thetacom$ remains minimal, particularly for the T2K flux.
     This suggests that FSI models tuned using $\thetacom$, e.g. following the methodology in Ref.~\cite{GENIE:2021zuu}, will continue to be applicable even if the RES model undergoes future updates, thereby enhancing the robustness of such FSI model tuning.

     As noted in Sec.~\ref{sec:mc-com}, the $\thetacom$ distribution is influenced by the production of higher resonances that decay through the same channels as $\deltapp$.
     The impact is two-fold.
     Firstly, due to general difference of $\thetaR$ from $\thetapidel$, $\thetacom$ would start to deviate from $\thetapidel$ (smeared by FSI), as shown in Fig.~\ref{subfig:enu-comp-cc1pi1p}. 
     Although $\thetacom$ is inspired by $\thetapidel$, it is not restricted to the reconstruction or estimation of $\thetapidel$. 
     Rather, $\thetacom$ by definition is the superposition of all energetically accessible $\thetaR$, with $\thetapidel$ being the dominant component at low energy.
     If all $\thetaR$'s are relatively well understood, a simple theoretically motivated expectation of $\thetacom$ can be obtained by adding the contributions from all possible R according to the relative production ratios.
     This simple approach is complicated by the second point - even with a complete understanding of the FSI model, the predicted $\thetacom$ distribution would deviate from measurements due to correlations among different resonance production modes, i.e. the overall $\thetacom$ is not simply a linear combination of the individual $\thetaR$ contributions.
     Nevertheless, the influence of higher resonances is minor for low-energy neutrino beams and can be further reduced by applying an upper cut on the COM total energy, ensuring that the selected events predominantly arise from $\deltapp$ decay.
     As FSI modeling improves and single-resonance models are refined through constraints from other experiments, the COM total energy cut could be lifted. 
     This would enable the full $\thetacom$ distribution to be used for studying correlations and advancing RES modeling.

     The sensitivity of the COM frame to FSI can be leveraged not only to study FSI but also to select events without FSI. 
     These events are primarily composed of $\nu$-H interactions, which provide a unique opportunity for precise measurements of the axial current—a feature specific to neutrinos. 
     Additionally, a $\nu$-H sample allows for the improvement of $\nu$-H modeling without the complications of IS and FSI, facilitating accurate neutrino energy reconstruction. 
     These advantages have driven significant efforts to develop techniques for selecting a high-purity $\nu$-H sample, as seen in Ref.~\cite{Lu:2015hea,MINERvA:2023avz,Baudis:2023tma}.
     While Ref.~\cite{Baudis:2023tma} and Ref.~\cite{MINERvA:2023avz} focuses on neutrino and antineutrino pion-less events respectively, Ref.~\cite{Lu:2015hea} applies to the same event topology as the COM total energy. 
     Preliminary studies have shown that applying a cut on COM energy can remove events with minimal transverse momentum imbalance, which could be combined with cuts on $\dptt$ and $\dpt$ to create a high-purity $\nu$-H sample. 
     This approach will be explored further in future studies.

     Although the COM angle shares a similar reconstruction target with the Adler angle, there are key differences, as discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:com-ana}. 
     While these differences may appear minor, the conceptual distinction makes tuning the FSI model using the COM angle more adaptable to future developments. 
     Furthermore, the analyses presented here are based on true information without any realistic fluctuations, meaning that challenges related to reconstruction—particularly those involving neutrino energy for the Adler angle—are not considered. 
     Therefore, the full potential of the COM angle will be better realized in a cross-section measurement that accounts for these complexities.

     \subsection{Reconstruction Quality}
     \label{sec:com-reco}
     The above discussion assumes true information, with ideal particle kinematics and selection criteria. It is important to assess the practicality of this approach by evaluating the uncertainties in reconstructing the COM variables. Therefore, I calculated the COM variables using the $\numuccopiop$ selection, identical to that used for the TKI calculation above. The reconstruction results are presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:com-reco}.

          \caption{COM variables for the $\numuccopiop$ selection.}
          \label{fig:com-reco}
     \end{figure}
     The analysis presented in Sec.~\ref{sec:com-ana} uses a binning of $20\deg$ for $\thetacom$. In contrast, Fig.~\ref{subfig:reco-com-t-res} demonstrates that the reconstruction has an excellent half-width of $2.6\deg$, significantly smaller than the analysis binning. This suggests that reconstruction will not impede the model differentiation capability discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:com-ana} and may even enhance it due to the superb reconstruction quality of the SFGD. The fitted half-width of $\ecom$ is approximately $6.0~\mev$, which is also exceedingly precise. It will be more relevant for hydrogen sample selection, as discussed in the next section. 

     \subsection{Conclusion}
     This study introduces a novel set of variables—the COM angle and total energy. These variables possess several advantageous properties, which motivate their use in future cross-section measurements. Such measurements have the potential to significantly enhance our understanding and modeling of Final State Interaction (FSI) processes in neutrino-nucleus interactions, thereby contributing to more accurate neutrino cross-section predictions. The reconstruction quality of the COM variables has been shown to be excellent, and it is promising that actual measurements can outperform the potential demonstrated in the true MC study.

\section{Hydrogen Sample Selection}
\label{sec:mc-hydrogen}
The importance of a high-purity $\nu$-H sample has been discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:dis} (please verify the exact location).
There has been growing interest and effort in developing techniques to select such a sample, as discussed in Ref.~\cite{Lu:2015hea,MINERvA:2023avz,Baudis:2023tma}.
While Ref.~\cite{MINERvA:2023avz} and Ref.~\cite{Baudis:2023tma} focus on $\nu$-H events in antineutrino and neutrino pion-less samples, respectively, Ref.~\cite{Lu:2015hea} applies to events with pions in the final state. 
They complement each other well.
The proposal in Ref.~\cite{Lu:2015hea} is to use $\dptt$ to select $\nu$-H events.
It is challenging to achieve high efficiency and purity with a one-dimensional cut. 
Therefore, a COM total energy cut is proposed to complement $\dptt$, and this section demonstrates its effectiveness.

\subsection{MC Study}
\label{sec:mc-hydrogen-ana}
     The key to removing carbon backgrounds from hydrogen events is to identify variables that effectively differentiate between the two.
     Therefore, distributions decomposed by target nucleus type are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:hsel-tki-decomp} for the proposed variables.

     As shown in Fig.~\ref{subfig:hsel-dptt-stack}
     \begin{figure}
     \begin{subfigure}[b]{\dbfigwid\textwidth}
          \centering
          \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/perf/tki/SFGpTPCmu_dptt_stack_al15.eps}
          \caption{$\dptt$}
          \label{subfig:hsel-dptt-stack}
     \end{subfigure}
     \begin{subfigure}[b]{\dbfigwid\textwidth}
          \centering
          \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/perf/tki/SFGpTPCmu_dpt_stack_al15.eps}
          \caption{$\dpt$}
          \label{subfig:hsel-dpt-stack}
     \end{subfigure}
     \caption{Decomposed distributions for $\dptt$ and $\dpt$ for hydrogen and carbon events.}
     \label{fig:hsel-tki-decomp}
     \end{figure}
     Based on $\dptt$ alone, the most effective cut is $-10\mevc \leq \dptt \leq 30\mevc$.
     This cut yields 16 hydrogen events and 16 carbon events, for a purity of $50\%$.
     In comparison, Ref.~\cite{MINERvA:2023avz} reported ``5,580(180) signal events over an estimated background of 12,500 events,'' which corresponds to a lower purity than $50\%$ but a much larger total number of events.
     Hence, for the T2K sample to be most useful, maximizing purity is essential to minimize systematic uncertainties in parameter measurements.

     Because SFGD excels in 3D tracking, a cut on $\dpt$ may further reduce carbon backgrounds.
     A similar decomposition is shown in Fig.~\ref{subfig:hsel-dpt-stack} for $\dpt$.
     It is observed that $\dpt$ and $\dptt$ for hydrogen events cluster near $0$, while carbon events exhibit more spread.
     Since the variables are not entirely independent (because $\abs{\dptt} \leq \dpt$), identifying a suitable two-dimensional cut is simpler by plotting them together, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:hsel-dpt-dptt} for hydrogen and carbon separately.
     \begin{figure}
          \begin{subfigure}[b]{\dbfigwid\textwidth}

               \caption{Hydrogen events}
               \label{subfig:hsel-dpt-dptt-h}
          \end{subfigure}
          \begin{subfigure}[b]{\dbfigwid\textwidth}

               \caption{Carbon events}

          \end{subfigure}
          \caption{Two-dimensional distributions of $\dpt$ and $\dptt$ for hydrogen and carbon events.}
          \label{fig:hsel-dpt-dptt}
     \end{figure}

     Fig.~\ref{fig:hsel-dpt-dptt} suggests the cuts, $\dpt < 80\mevc$ and $-40\mevc \leq \dptt \leq 30\mevc$, which lead to a sample of $19$ hydrogen events and $10$ carbon events, with a purity of $65.5\%$.
     This is the optimal purity and efficiency achievable by using TKI variables only.
     To further improve the purity, an additional cut on the COM variables is proposed.
     Similar to Fig.~\ref{fig:hsel-tki-decomp}, the decompositions for the COM variables are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:hsel-com-decomp}.
     Although FSI alters the $\thetacom$ distributions, leading to distinct distributions between hydrogen and carbon, $\thetacom$ for hydrogen is expected to be uniform across the entire range; therefore, the cut on $\thetacom$ to select hydrogen is not expected to be effective.
     Note that to show the wide range of $\thetacom$ for hydrogen, the colours for hydrogen and carbon are switched in Fig.~\ref{subfig:hsel-com-theta} respectively.
     In contrast, without FSI, $\ecom$ is expected to center around the mass of the resonance, which is $1232~\mev$ for $\deltapp$, while the carbon events are expected to have a much wider distribution, as shown in Fig.~\ref{subfig:hsel-com-edelta}.
     \begin{figure}
     \begin{subfigure}[b]{\dbfigwid\textwidth}
          \centering
          \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/perf/tki/SFGpTPCmu_edelta_stack_al14.eps}
          \caption{$\ecom$}
          \label{subfig:hsel-com-edelta}

     \begin{subfigure}[b]{\dbfigwid\textwidth}

     \caption{Decomposed distributions for $\ecom$ and $\thetacom$ for hydrogen and carbon events.}
     \label{fig:hsel-com-decomp}
     \end{figure}
     Hence, an additional cut, $???<\ecom<???$, is implemented to further reduce the carbon backgrounds, achieving a sample of $18$ hydrogen events and $5$ carbon events, with an impressive purity of $78\%$.

     To demonstrate the effectiveness of these cuts, the $\dptt$ distributions are plotted step-wise in Fig.~\ref{fig:hsel-dptt-step}.
     Comparing the $\dptt$ distributions before and after each cut, namely the cuts on $\dpt$ and $\ecom$, it is evident that these cuts successfully remove carbon backgrounds in the low $\dptt$ region, which is impossible to remove based on $\dptt$ alone.
     Furthermore, by comparing Fig.~\ref{subfig:hsel-dang-dpt80} and Fig.~\ref{subfig:hsel-dang-dpt80-ecom}, it is demonstrated that the cut on $\ecom$ is capable of removing carbon backgrounds that cannot be removed by the transverse variables.
     Hence, all three variables are indispensable for achieving the optimal purity and efficiency.

     \subsection{Discussion}
     Both the transverse variables and $\ecom$ have limitations.
     The true distributions of the transverse variables on hydrogen are delta functions, but the dependence on an accurate neutrino direction reconstruction limits the reconstruction resolution of the transverse variables.
     The impact of the resolution is amplified as the cuts are placed to select events with small values when reconstruction uncertainties could relatively easily move the signal events out of the cut.
     On the other hand, while $\ecom$ has excellent reconstruction quality as it is independent of neutrino direction, its true distribution has a natural half-width of about $60~\mev$~\cite{ParticleDataGroup:2024cfk}.
     Hence, even if $\ecom$ can be reconstructed perfectly, it cannot separate hydrogen events from carbon events completely.
     Due to the limited amount of MC events available and the relatively small fraction of resonance events in the T2K beam, the statistics of the selection are too small to be conclusive.
     Nevertheless, the results are promising and suffice in demonstrating the complementarity of the transverse variables and $\ecom$.
     Hence, it is hopeful that using the two kinds of variables together, the upgraded ND280 data can produce a hydrogen sample with high purity.
